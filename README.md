### Manual testing

Use static-server npm package for manual testing. Install it first with the following command and then run it in the project's directory. The site will be available on http://localhost:9080/ by default.

```sh
$ npm install -g static server
```

There is a switcher with three radio buttons (success, error and process) which control backend mock behavior. Click on that switch uptades the [action] attribute of the form with the link to appropriate local file.
